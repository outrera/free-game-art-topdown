A set of RPG heroes, perfect for your 4 member party :D

Comes with 4 expressions.

Depending on the reception, I may make more on this style. I'm also gonna make field sprites for these (on a new template), drawn facesets, etc. In fact I'm working on a small RPG to keep myself motivated to make public resources :D

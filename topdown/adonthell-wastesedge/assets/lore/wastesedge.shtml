<p><strong>Location:</strong> Waste's Edge is situated on the high plain of
Belerinath at the headwaters of the Elenstroem. The land south of the river
rises gently towards a range of low hills, that stretches all the way from
Cirdanth in the west to the nearby mountains. Jagged cliffs on the hills far
side form the southern coast of the continent and prevent the landing of any
ocean going vessel.</p>

<p>Not far to the east lie the Oreth-Arinyae, the Mountains of Dawn, home to
 many
Dwarves. Their closest settlement, Uzdun'kal, lies not far from the spring of
the Elenstroem that makes its way over numerous falls and rapids down to the
plain of Belerinath.</p>

<p>On the remaining sides, Waste's Edge is surrounded by dense, primeval forest,
dotted with a few small villages inhabited by Half-Elves and Men. The nearest
cities are Elgilad, the High City of Elves to the north, and Cirdanth, the
elven Haven at the western tip of the mainland.</p>

<p><strong>History:</strong> For many centuries, a limited amount of trade
between Elves and Dwarfs has taken place along the Elenstroem. The Elves desired
precious ores and gems for their workings of magic and in exchange the Dwarves
received all kinds of food they could not grow in the harsh mountain climate.
Most of the actual travelling was done by Half-Elves, loyal and obedient
servants to the elven Lords and Ladies, who did not mind the long journey
through uninhabited wilderness, as is their nature.</p>

<p>With the arrival of Men, the situation changed. Their need for all kinds of
 ore
as well as for the renowned dwarvish armour and weapons was by far larger. Soon
big caravans were making their way through the wilderness, an easy prey for
brigands and rivalling chieftains. The voyage by boat up the Elenstroem proved
to be safer, but near the Oreth-Arinyae rapids made the river unnavigable.
The boats had to stay behind, while the crews were carrying the goods into the
mountains. As the landing saw more and more traffic, crude docks were erected,
improved and rebuilt over the years.</p>

<p>Not long and it occurred to the merchants that boats moored on the plain of
Belerinath, waiting for the return of their crews were not earning any revenues.
In a combined effort, they had storehouses erected at the docks, so that
both caravans from the mountains and boats coming up the Elenstroem could pick
up new freight without much delay.</p>

<p>Any place seeing that much traffic attracts more people, seeking for new
opportunities, and soon a smithy, two farms and the Redwyne Inn joined the
small harbour. To provide protection against bandits, the Inn was
surrounded by a wall and a small fee collected from every mooring ship pays
for a number of guards.</p>

<p>Still, Waste's Edge lies too remote, and too far in elven territory, to grow
into anything different than the small trading post it has been for many generations.

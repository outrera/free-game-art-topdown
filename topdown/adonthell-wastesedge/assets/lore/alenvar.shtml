<tr><td class="bmid">Of Alenvar - an excerpt of the Miloran
Cycle</td></tr></table>

<em><p><i>Of all Elven legends, the Miloran Cycle is certainly the most
fascinating.  It not only plays a pivotal role in the history of the Elves, but
is also remembered in such great detail. If you ever happen to meet an Elvish
storyteller, you will find that he could speak for hours about Alenvar's first
journey alone.  You could listen for days and hear no more than a part of the
Cycle.</i></p>

<p><i>After spending most of my life with the elves of Forenor, I feel that I
 should pass on some of my knowledge to those of my people who haven't had the
 good fortune to be welcome among the Fair Folk. This is the story of Alenvar I
 wish to tell, and although we will meet other key figures of the Miloran Cycle
 as they cross his path, they must remain in the background. The same is true
 for many of Alenvar's deeds, as I do not wish to simply recount the numerous
 battles with his foes, but the inner struggles that determined his, and in the
 end his people's, fate.</i><br>&nbsp;</p></em>

<p>When after the long odyssey Menagond of the Wood-elves and the wise and
 beautiful Telimae found together, they had a son and they named him Alenvar.
 He grew up to become a skilled hunter and soon surpassed his father in strength
 and might, and of his mother he learned much of the great lore of old.<br>
His journeys took him far to the north and long he wandered unseen in the lands
 of Men, where he became aware of preparations as of war.  And being uneased and
 roused by these tidings, he went to Elgilad, the Elvish chief city at the river
 Elenstroem, and spoke before the Council.  His account bore no great surprise
 however, for Men were already entering the realm of Elves in large numbers,
 although most of them were simple folk that kept away from Elvish
 settlements.</p>

<p>`Ever since Men first crossed the mountains, we have given way to them',
 Alenvar  said.  `But now we have to stand and fight ere we are washed into the
 sea!'<br>
There the Wise learned of the fire that was in him and Marglir Evenstar, First
 of all Great said: `More war has been waged by those of Elven lineage than most
 of us know, and no good came of it.  And I sense a bad end coming upon you, if
 you do not rein your hatred.'</p>

<p>But the Wise also knew how great a warrior Alenvar was, and they feared that
 he would not listen to reason, but rather go and fight the battle on his own.
 To prevent him from such foolishness, they chose to give him an occupation to
 his liking in the hope that the task at hand would calm his restless spirit.
 He received command over a score of rangers and was sent north to watch the
 borders and drive away any trespasser.  But unforseeable are the ways of fate,
 and on this errand he was, when the shadow befell him and he became estranged
 to his folk and its customs.
They had made camp in the fair country around the Foroduin, the river marking
 the northern border, where still many Elves dwelled; and from there, alone or
 in pairs they went about their business.  It was so that Alenvar met Andomiel
 and, although he did not know her, like a fair summer day she seemed to him as
 she walked among the trees, and his heart was filled with delight.<br>
But even before he could step onto the path to greet her, he became aware of a
 faint sound as of swift and light footsteps, and from the brush came a horde of
 filthy men, their eyes glittering with lust as they approached their prey.
 They wore ragged furs and carried long daggers, but some of them had bows also
 and their bare feet made hardly any noise on the soft ground.<br>
Andomiel froze as she saw her doom ahead, but out of the trees came Alenvar and
 with a mighty stroke of his sword, he beheaded the nearest foe.  Then the
 remaining villains came upon him.  Yet, with a few hews, he drove them apart,
 and those still on their feet turned and fled into the forest.</p>

<p>But perilous are Men even in their defeat, and just as Andomiel turned to
 meet Alenvar, full of strange and wondrous feelings, an arrow came flying from
 under the trees.  Though it was badly aimed and only pierced her shoulder, she
 fell where she stood, for an icy poison was entering her body, and she died in
 Alenvar`s arms.  But at the moment of her doom she gazed into his eyes and so
 deep her love for him was, that her soul went not beyond, but straight to her
 heart's desire.  And so eyes met eyes, and souls met souls, and deep within
 Alenvar, a part of her lived forth.</p>

<p>His companions, stirred by the din of battle, found him kneeling besides
 Andomiel, who even in death was fair to look at; and Isgil, who was friend with
 Alenvar, recognised her and cried: `Unfortunate Andomiel! Your curse is broken,
 but only short was your luck.' <br>
Now they were bewildered and curious and they began to question Alenvar and
 there they became aware of the change that had befallen him. For he stared
 ahead with lifeless eyes and would not answer, and his spirit remained closed
 to them.</p>

<p>So they took them both back to the camp and laid Alenvar to rest in his tent.
  Andomiel they buried under a lonely tree in the centre of the clearing.  Then
 they held counsel, for they knew no advice and none of them had learned how to
 tend wounds of heart or mind.  But even greater was their surprise and
 confusion, when they returned to the tent and found Alenvar gone, with no trace
 or sign showing them the path he had taken, and it was a long time, ere they
 heard of him again.</p>

<p>Long wandered Alenvar in darkness.  He ate when he felt hungry and slept when
 he was tired, but his mind was clouded with pain and anger and a steadily
 increasing hatred of Men and their evil doings.  Although he went where chance
 might take him in this pathless country, guided only by Andomiel`s spirit, he
 travelled mostly southwards and was not far from Elgilad when he finally
 reached the Elenstroem.  And there, the merry tinkling of the water as it ran
 with much haste along its stony bed, chased his dark thoughts away, and for the
 first time since Andomiel's death did he come to senses. And there at the
 waterside, against all Elvish traditions, he swore an oath to free his people
 from the menace of Men.</p>

<p>With this intent he came to the High City and people looked at him with
 wonder, for a fire was gleaming in his eyes, and although his clothes were
 ragged and hung in pieces from his dirty skin, his steps were firm and steady,
 and like a king he walked the streets, not like the beggar he seemed to be.
 Straight to the Council he went and great was the surprise among the Wise.  It
 was not his appearance which drew their attention, for they could see deeper,
 but the shadow in his heart and the fierceness in his eyes.<br>
`We had news that Alenvar, son of Menagond, is lost', Marglir spoke, `and alas!
 now that I see you before me, I must confess 'tis true indeed.'<br>
But Alenvar replied `Then your need has to be truly great, if the lost return to
 save you', and there they fell silent while he spoke long of battle and war.
 Of the human nature he told them, for much he had learned about their ways and
 thoughts on his journeys through their realms.  And of the errors of the Wise
 whenever dealing with Men, he accused them.  Men would never renounce a thing
 they could easily take, and to them, the Elvish land seemed such a thing.  `And
 once their soldiers come to plunder and pillage, many of our folk will perish
 on the battlefield and even more will be slain in their homes or taken to
 slavery.  But bring the war to them and they might realize that we are not an
 easy prey at all!' Thus spoke Alenvar.</p>

<p>There Marglir said: `Can't you see that violence is not the way to deal with
 Men? Or did your resistance prevent Andomiel from her fate?' and so Alenvar
 learned how great a loss he really suffered and this only added to his
 obsession.  And Marglir saw that he himself had lead up to Alenvar's fall, and
 he was sad and full of compassion; and he finally said: `To send our folk to
 war lies beyond the Councils authority, but if this is your wish, you may bring
 forth your request and lead those willing to follow you against Men.' But deep
 within his heart he hoped that others would see the errors in Alenvar's way and
 bring him back to senses.</p>

<p>But Marglir did not know how much Telimae had taught her son, and when
 Alenvar spoke before his people, he recounted many tales of old, where Elves
 had striven for peace, but the chieftains of Men never kept their oaths for
 long, and peacefulness always turned out disadvantageous. Andomiel's spirit
 gave him the strength to reach into the hearts of those who listened to his
 words and so many amongst the crowd were willing to accompany him. But some
 said: `Who are you, to speak against the Council?' and there Isgil, who
 happened to be in Elgilad at that time, stood up and told of Alenvar's great
 deeds in the northern mark, and so the remaining doubts were cast aside and all
 who were skilled in the use of weapons followed Alenvar out of their free will;
 and after that, Isgil was made second in command.  But those who could not
 follow Alenvar into battle spread the news of his plans.  And so, many more
 came to his aid and when he left he led a host of 1000 fighters, armed with
 bows and spears. But some carried swords of steel and were clad in dwarvish
 mail, and those were led by Isgil.</p>

<p>On secret and hidden paths they came into the north and no message of their
 intention came to human ears.  Now Elvish scouts told Alenvar of many armed Men
 gathering near Farandale, a human city not far from Aerengist, where the
 Foroduin was calm and shallow and a ford crossed the river.  And during a dark
 and moonless night Alenvar led his men across the river and with the first
 light of dawn they came unseen to Farandale and there more warriors where
 encamped than Elves were following Alenvar; but surprise was on his side and
 none of those Men ever left the battlefield again, and only few Elves fell.
 And when the people of Farandale saw what happened, they fled in terror and
 Alenvar laid fire to their homes.  There Isgil said: `Is it not enough that we
 slay their kindred and put fear into their hearts?  You are the man no longer
 that won kind Andomiel's love.'  But Alenvar in his anger swore at him and
 after that their friendship grew cold.</p>

<p>Soon the chieftains of Men learned of the Elvish battalion and the defeat of
 their army at Farandale and they were more watchful in their own lands.  But
 Alenvar was familiar with the country from his previous wanderings and little
 news of his movements reached the warlords.  For now, they had to give him free
 hand and many more settlements shared their fate with Farandale.  There was
 little fighting though, since only few could withstand the sight of Alenvar and
 his fellow Elves approaching, with stern faces and in absolute silence.  But
 what first appeared to be easily won victories turned out perilous for
 Alenvar.<br>
By driving the people away instead of killing them, and by laying waste to their
 homes, so they had nothing to return to, many refugees went further north,
 where it was easy for the warlords to gather willing soldiers for another, even
 larger army.</p>

<p>Now Isgil, fearing that Alenvar was no longer guided by the aim to aid his
 people, but had given way to his own, dark obsession, made a final approach to
 soothe his friend:<br>
`Have you not fulfilled your oath' he asked. `If there are Men left that have
 not learned to respect our kind, you will never teach them.  Retreat now and
 the lesson will be well remembered, but let them defeat you and all your
 efforts will come to nothing.'  But in his pride, and because his hatred of
 everything concerning Men was now unbound, Alenvar despised the warning and so
 Marglir's prediction began to fulfil itself. For Isgil, driven by some
 strange, inner voice, began to speak in secrecy against his former friend, and
 many were willing to listen, and they watched Alenvar's mood with disquiet and
 no longer trusted into his leadership.  So far, they had suffered few losses
 and caused much damage, but every new day put them into greater danger and most
 of them had already enough of their destructive business and of the harsh and
 desolate land.</p>

<p>Then accounts of another army of Men marching southwards reached them, and
 they sat together to make plans.  Isgil and many of his secret followers shared
 the opinion that the warlords were not interested in battle if not confronted
 and that it would be best to retreat over the Foroduin.  Alenvar however was
 not so faithful.  He knew the hearts of Men best, and to him it was obvious
 that they would seek vengeance and such he told them, and also where the best
 location for an ambush was in this country.  But, already spoilt by Isgil,
 weary of further battles and anticipating the return, most Elves overheard the
 truth in Alenvar's words and few took his doubts serious.  Instead they made
 his well known temper responsible for the intention to launch another attack
 and in the end, Alenvar had to give in to them.</p>

<p>So they returned, save a few trusted kinsmen that were left behind by Alenvar
 to watch the warlords' doings.  There was much joy among the Elves as they
 crossed the Foroduin and came into their own country again, and there they
 rested and all dark thoughts and sorrow fell from them.  Only Alenvar found no
 peace, for he feared that Men would not be so merciful once they brought the
 war to the Elvish realm.  When finally messengers arrived, with news of the
 nearing enemy, he was fully consumed by his obsessions, and he could not bear
 the thought of Men setting their foot on Elvish land.  And when his fellows,
 alarmed by the unexpected development, and still remembering Alenvar's words
 about the human thirst for revenge, asked him what to do, he decided against
 all common sense to hold the ford of Aerengist against the foe.  He and his
 fighters would guard the entrance to the ford, but Isgil should remain hidden
 to attack the enemy from behind.  This time, Isgil did not argue, for he was
 eyed with suspicion now, but deep inside his heart he was worried and fear grew
 in him.  So they parted, and while Isgil vanished into the nearby hills,
 Alenvar took position at the riverbank to await the assault.</p>

<p>It came after dawn, when mist that had risen from the Foroduin still hovered
 over the valley and clouded the opponents' sight.  But Isgil, out of his
 elevated position, could see how numerous the enemy was: row upon row filled
 the valley from one end to the other, and there all courage left him and, sure
 death in his eyes, he took his men and fled and it was much later ere he found
 forgiveness.  Only one of his warriors, Thalin by name, withstood Isgil's order
 and went to his peoples aid, and a few of his kindred went with him.  When they
 came near the ford, the battle was already against Alenvar, and only with much
 effort and under great losses he could hold back the enemy.  Now they made
 haste and fought their way to Alenvar's banner, and little harm they suffered
 for their armour was strong and of high craftsmanship.  So they met in the
 midst of battle, and as Thalin told of Isgil's treachery, sadness came upon
 Alenvar and the darkness fell of him at last and he saw that the battle was
 lost.  There he ordered retreat, but he and Thalin and those with him remained
 to hold back the hordes of Men.  Suddenly the first sunbeams broke through the
 mist, making water and dewdrops in the grass gleam in all the rainbow's colours,
 and within the circle of light stood Alenvar with his companions, and such an
 impressive sight they were, that the attack came to a halt. So many of the
 Elves would escape across the river and into the forest before the humans
 recovered from their frozen awe and threw themselves at the remaining
 defenders.  And in the end, only Alenvar stood, and many more he slew before
 his death and when the warlords finally came into the realm of Elves, many of
 their fighters lay dead at the ford of Aerengist and only little mischief they
 caused before they were scattered and driven back.</p>

<p>So ended the greatest of Elvish warriors of this age, but from then on many
 Elves learned the art of warfare and although they never became a warlike folk,
 they could defend themselves much better against any assaults and this they owe
 to Alenvar.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ancient legends tell of a long, forgotten age of peace and
prosperity, of the perfection of art and science, of a joyful life
in a paradise on earth.</p>

<p>Even the old and wise know not whether any truth lies
within those tales, or if they simply arose out of the
people's desire for a better life in this dark period. It is not
known, either, which event has caused the decay of this marvellous
state.<br>
Some scholars claim that these stories depict the age before the
human race took possession of the world. A gradual process that was
unstoppable by the time, when the true human nature was uncovered.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the surviving Dwarves dwell in the most remote corners of
the world, far away from any humans. On the contrary, the elven lineage
mingles more and more with the human's and only few of the ancient folk
are still of pure blood.</p>

<p>
So far, peace remains. But only a few generations have passed
since the last great war, and the situation becomes more
critical every year. The island of Adonthell, far of all mainland shores,
had made a sizeable contribution to the balance between
humans and elves for many years. It was the place unto that the
<img src="studying.png" width="180" height="278"

scholar Vertas once brought books otherwise destroyed during the
past war. In the years following, many travelled there to study the
wisdom accumulated by Vertas, leaving their own findings behind.
Soon after the war came to an end, the Guild of Arts was
founded on Adonthell to shelter this wisdom as well as the ones
seeking it. Even at this time of great enmity between the races,
everyone was allowed to visit Adonthell and study at the Guild. But,
as the isle itself belonged to the Elves for almost a thousand
years now, the knowledge collected on its very soil remained in
their hands as well.
</p>

<p>Never was the unspoken armistice broken, and peace remained on
Adonthell, whereas elsewhere neither Elf nor Dwarf was completely
safe from human brigands and other unkind folk. The human race,
plenty in numbers, was clearly dominant, but with their knowledge
of the arcane arts and their unsurpassed craftsmanship, the Elves
were able to resist all forms of assault so far.</p>

<p>But then the inconceivable happened: heavy storms began to strike
the sea around Adonthell. Clearly, they were not natural, as they
appeared all of a sudden and caused the sinking of many a ship.

Soon the island was cut off the mainland. No seaman would dare to sail
the surrounding waters, and those who did never returned.</p>

<p>
Four decades have passed since then, and all attempts to
bring an end to the storms were fruitless. Now the days of the remaining Elves
are not far from being over. Their might has dwindled with each scholar
dying before passing on his wisdom, and soon, nothing will be left
to hold back the ever pushing Men. Only the lore to be found within
the Guild of Arts might still turn their doom away. At this dark
hour, someone is needed to reveal the secret of the storms, and to
decide the fate of Elves.
</p>

<p>And although much is uncertain, one thing is standing firm: the
solution to this problem can only be found on the island of
Adonthell itself ...<br>&nbsp;</p>

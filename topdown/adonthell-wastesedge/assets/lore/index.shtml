<p>As we go about designing the world Adonthell will be set in,
important events and individuals of both long gone and more recent times come
into being. Together with the more abstract concepts of the world, such as
geographic, cultural or political aspects, these will be presented here in the
form of essays, short stories and legends. The idea behind is to give the world
that extra bit of texture, that comes with the detailed background collected
here. None of the information given will be required to play the actual game,
nor will it contain spoilers. However, it might explain why certain characters
behave in a certain way and, in some cases, it could also help to understand
what the hell they are talking about. But mainly it's for you to enjoy (and for
our designers to get things right).</p>

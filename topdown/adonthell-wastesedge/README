Installation:
=============

See the INSTALL file for details.

Note that this package is designed to run along with the adonthell
game engine version 0.3.x. Therefore, you need it installed or you'll
be stuck at configure time. If you don't have it, download it from
http://adonthell.linuxgames.com/download/.


Running Adonthell - Waste's Edge:
=================================

If the installation process is successfull, you're ready to play.
You can play by invoking 'adonthell wastesedge' but there is a little
shell script named 'adonthell-wastesedge' that will do the work for 
you. See the PLAYING file for more detailed instructions.


Release Notes:
==============

The main purpose of this release is to attract new programmers, 
artists and writers in order to shorten the time until the next 
version.  So if you have experience in C++ (and optionally Python), 
or if you are good at computer graphics or writing we would like to
hear from you.  Please have a look at our development site 
  
  http://adonthell.linuxgames.com/development/join.shtml

for further details.

Adonthell - Waste's Edge -, or v0.3 for short is no complete RPG.
As the v0.3 implies, the engine is far from being finished, although
it should be free of severe bugs.  Missing features include combat, 
items and magic.  But you can interact with NPC's and the game world, 
and the internals enable us to create a basic plot, so v0.3 is actually
playable!

You're greatly invited to report us bugs, problems, or anything you
think we should know. Any feedback is appreciated, so don't hesitate!

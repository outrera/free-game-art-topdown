Diagonal walkcycle and runcycle for LPC figures, licensed CC-By-Sa 3.0/GPL 3.0

by Wolthera van Hövell tot Westerflier

Based on the original LPC walkcycles by Stephen Challener (AKA Redshrike)


I discovered there were no runcycles. So I tried to do something about that. Then I realised there were no diagonal walkcycles either so I tried to fix that... and finally I ended up with the responsibility to make diagonal runcycles as well... That part didn't work out to well...

I might get back to refining these, but I've been staring a little blind on them. It should be useful already in it's current state.

Included are the original kra files with animation, png spritesheets and ora files with the arms and heads separated for easier editing.

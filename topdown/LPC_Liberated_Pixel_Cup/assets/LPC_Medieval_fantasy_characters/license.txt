My entry for the Liberated Pixel cup. See the README for more information and animated gif examples.

Contains various sprites listed in the tags, most of it modular and interchangable.

The archive expansion_pack contains some more sprites made after the contest was over.

Version 0.04 of the expansion pack contains:
- Shield, longsword and rapier for slash animation.
- Longer spear for thrust.
- Bow animations for skeleton.
- Missing quiver png for bow animation.
- Combat dummy death.

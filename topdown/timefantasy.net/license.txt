Are these sprite sheets released under a specific license? I ask because I am looking for sprites that are compatible with a GPL licensed game project that I am part of. From the sound of the description, many of these sprites could be licensed under CC0/Public domain? I just need to make sure that I don’t add any artwork to the game that isn’t compatible with the GPL.

For my free bonus releases like this, no specific license but no real restrictions either. So yes, that is fine.

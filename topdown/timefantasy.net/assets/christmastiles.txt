I was going to release these on Christmas Day, but I figure that I should release them early so you can get some use out of them leading up to Christmas.

As always, theyâ€™re arranged in a simple grid and can be added to any tileset.

These are free for everyone to use without any restrictions. Enjoy! Thanks!

HO HO HO MERRY CHRISTMAS

Iâ€™ve got some more free graphics for you! Here are some new trees to add more variety to your worlds:

The above image is the upscaled version that fits the size of the RPG Maker versions of the Time Fantasy packs. Here are the regular-sized trees if you want those instead.

I was originally going to make a decorated Christmas tree as the free resource, but I decided that it would be better to release something more versatile, and more tree varieties are something that have been requested a bunch of times. Have fun with them, and Merry Christmas.

See you in the new year. :)

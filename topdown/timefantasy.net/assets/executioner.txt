Hello! Here’s a new sprite. It’s a freebie for everyone!

This is a small release that I made to go with yesterday’s patron release: gallows tiles add-on.

Note: If you’re using RPG Maker, you’ll want to add a “$” to the beginning of the filename so it works properly as a single sheet. Animate the axe sheet by rotating him down/left/right/up.

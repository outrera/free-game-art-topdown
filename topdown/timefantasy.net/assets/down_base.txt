Hello friends!

I’ve begun creating downed/dead/sleeping/KO/etc poses for characters in the Time Fantasy asset packs. I start by making a “base”– I’m releasing that base today for free. If anybody is working in the Time Fantasy style, you can use these based to make downed sprites for your characters.

I’ll have some full downed sprites, based on the existing TF character sprites, in the upcoming weeks. Until then. :)

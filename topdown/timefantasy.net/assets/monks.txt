Hello! Here’s some new characters. Free for everyone!

I’ve been reading a really fascinating book, an autobiography of a swami– and it gave me the inspiration to put these sprites together. It’s been a while since I’ve made some characters for a free release for everyone, and I thought that it would be in the spirit of these characters to do just that. I’m sure that lots of people will find a good use for these sprites!

There are four characters. Each one has a regular full 4-directional walking sprite and a sitting meditation pose. They’re arranged in the standard 8-character sheet.

Hey guys. These trees are actually old- I made them when I was developing the Time Fantasy style. I found them while looking through my TF stuff, and realized that I haven’t release these. So here we go!

As usual, these are arranged in a 16×16 grid and should be easy to pop into any tileset.

The above trees are the 1x regular version. If you’re using these in RPG Maker, the upscaled version will fit the Time Fantasy resources:

Have fun. See you next time.

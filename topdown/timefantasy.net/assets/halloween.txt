This is a mini-pack that includes a bunch of Halloween-themed graphics. I'm releasing this set as a special free download for everybody.

These are all graphics that I've previously shared on patreon over the past two years. I'm excited to release these for a larger audience.

Includes:

    Halloween Tiles
    Halloween Icons
    Blood Spatter Tiles
    Witch Sprite
    Ghost Sprite
    Grim Reaper Sprites
    Pumpkinhead Sprite with variations including a Headless Horseman
    Vampire (Male and Female), with Bat and Transformation Animation

I hope you get a lot of use out of these. Even though they're compiled around a Halloween theme, you can get use out of these graphics all-year round. Some of them originally weren't even designed for Halloween, but I included them because they were a good fit for the spooky theme! This pack will be useful for expanding your Time Fantasy world!

Have a safe and fun Halloween!

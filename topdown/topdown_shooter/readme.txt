Tons of free assets from yet another old unfinished project. I'm releasing them for free because I think developers will find them useful for prototyping or for game jams.

These are pixel art assets for use in a top-down shooter or tower defense type game.

This pack is zip file that includes a bunch of PNG images for sprites and animations:

3 player characters with 8 directional walking animations
9 different guns (can be used in all directions with the player sprites)
9 towers (based on the guns) with 3 upgrade levels each
slime monster! with animations
a bunch of cool crosshairs
miscellaneous animated effects, bulletc, etc
Basically its all the graphics used in the preview animations. :)

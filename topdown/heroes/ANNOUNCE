I am pleased to announce the release of Heroes-hq-sound-tracks 1.0.

This package contains "high quality" versions for some sound-tracks of
standard sound-track set (heroes-sound-tracks).

Because this package does not supply a new version for all
sound-tracks in the game, therefore you still have to
       INSTALL THE TWO SOUND-TRACK PACKAGES
(i.e., both heroes-sound-tracks and heroes-hq-sound-tracks).
The order does not matter.

This packages requires at least Heroes 0.21.

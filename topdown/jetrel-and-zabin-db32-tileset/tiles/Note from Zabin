This is still a work in progress. More polishing I feel is necessary. But I don't know when I'll get to it. There's a complete forest, mountains, beach, and coastal variations complete with water animations. The water animations will be improved upon more and so will the cliffs/rocks alpha blend to look under water. Maybe next winter I'll get to it.

I have plans for a whole castle/village in my head but who knows when that'll happen.

I can be motivated to keep working on this throughout the summer if I got support to help pay my bills on Patreon. Otherwise I'm busy outside mowing grass all summer to save up cash to last the winter.

Here's the  start of a bunch of remixed tilesets recolored using my slightly extended DB32 color palette. I had to add a few colors :-P to be able to achieve a good conversion.

This is pack 1 of my OGA (DB32) tilesets remixed. I'm basically trying to take my favorite OGA rpg assets and remix/recolor them so they work together, thus making them more useful to game developers.

Everything here is CC0 public domain. This is mostly Jetrel's work and a few derivitives I made based off his stuff and some trees I made based off surts CCO scraps. There's a few plants in there that comes from Hyptosis' mage City https://opengameart.org/content/mage-city-arcanos

Here's a link to where I post updates so you can see what I'm working on before it's finished, polished, and submitted. https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/my-favorite-oga-jrpg-tiles-remixed-db32wip

Here's a awesome tileable deep ocean/water animation. Included is the one made for The Battle for Wesnoth and one I threw together in 2 hours to work with my ZRPG tiles.

Now here's a story to go with the lovely H2O.

The Battle for Wesnoth is maybe the most polished up and feature complete FOSS game out there that I was lucky enough to discover back in 2008. Here's my BFW story.

I downloaded it on the home computer and my dad ended up getting addicted to killing orcs on BFW. Ocassionally over the past decade my dad and I would update to the latest version and play new campaings checking out the new features. It was fun watching the game grow and share that fun with my dad.

There's been 2 water animations made for BFW. This is the newest one made by zookeeper in 2015.

I contacted him a couple days ago and he said to consider his art public domain. Which is what I hoped he'd say and really makes me appreciate the FOSS community.

Check out the ZRPG Tiles that I'm organizing using this water animation and Jetrel's beautiful art. 

TODO:

1. Include zookeeper's shallow water with this submission.

2. Maybe be nice to give credit to his real name.

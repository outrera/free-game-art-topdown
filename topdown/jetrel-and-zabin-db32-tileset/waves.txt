This is my derivative of Leonard Pabin's animated ocean tileset. Here's the original https://opengameart.org/content/whispers-of-avalon-animated-ocean-tileset

Changes: Doubled the frames from 5 to 10. So it's a smoother running animation now. Added a shallow/deep effect and recolored it with my extended DB32 palette.

I remixed this years ago so it's a little sloppy and could be better but I think it's a big upgrade from the original.

It works perfect with my recoloration of zookeeper's BFW water animation. https://opengameart.org/content/the-battle-for-wesnoth-water-animation

Take a look here to see a screenshot of how I used this with my ZRPG tiles  https://opengameart.org/sites/default/files/forum-attachments/ZRPG3.png

The gif preview uses my remix of the old BFW water by Rhyging5. Which is available here https://opengameart.org/content/the-battle-for-wesnoth-old-water-animati...

The gif preview also has some palm trees made by Leonard Pabin and Frode Lindeijer aka (Modanung) for The Mana World.

I'm in the process of submitting all of this ZRPG stuff. So there's lots more comming soon.

Been busy this winter playing with expanding Jetrel's awesome RPG assets. Here's a link to where I post updates on the forums. https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/wip-zrpg-tiles-oga-remixed-jetrel-db3...

This is a huge amount of art all licensed public domain CC0. Jetrel and I would love to be credited for this amazing pixel art but we want it to be as useful as possible to game developers. So we're not legally requiring it. 

This is still a WIP but there's alot of useful stuff here already that can be remixed and used in your own game. 

I plan to keep expanding this ZRPG Tileset collection. This is only about  a 1/3 a game's worth of art here. So there's a lot I have planned in my head but I am busy working a full time job. I made a patreon if anybody feels like motivating me though ;p

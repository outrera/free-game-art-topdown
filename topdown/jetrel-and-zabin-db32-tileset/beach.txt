Special thanks goes to bluecarrot16 for the LPC Beach / Desert submission here https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-beach-desert

That really helped me figure out how I wanted to make the transition from forest to beach.

This is using mostly DB32.

Here's links to all the art you might see in that preview.

This is still WIP and so is the water animations.

I've included an attribution diagram which I feel is necessary in properly crediting the original artists.

TODO:

1.Castus's need completely redone to match Modanung's style.

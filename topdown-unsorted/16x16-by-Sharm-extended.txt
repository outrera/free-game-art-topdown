Sharm's Tiny 16 is one of my all time favorite OGA works.

http://opengameart.org/content/tiny-16-basic

So for this week's art challenge, Share The Love, I thought I'd have a go at adding the few extra pieces I envision would be needed to make a full game out of the set.  Namely, some weapons and a few extra animation frames.

Unfortunately, free time was even scarcier than normal this week, so I only managed to get extra frames ready for the male character along with some very basic weapons.

The extra frames are a left and right hand 'strike' pose and a 'hit react' pose.

Was really hoping to get to the female character, maybe even add some color variants and some weapons and hit react poses for the enemies.

Still, posting what I did manage to get done, maybe some day I'll get back to it or another (more talented) artist will complete the idea.  Sharm's set really is an amazing work, hopefully I haven't butchered it too badly here.  

Update 1:
Added Nudes by Evert.

Update 2:

Added sprites for female player.

Update 3:

Added Skeleton by Evert and bone by me.

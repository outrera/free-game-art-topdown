This is an overflow sprite, meaning it is meant to fit into a square but have the illusion of depth that allows it to poke out from the top of the square.  I did not give him walking animations, because in the game I was making him for, he does not move.  If you want walking animations for this character, consider commissioning me!

If you have a game project that needs custom art, let me know what you are looking for.  I may be able to work out a deal with you, or I may already be working on similar art.  Good luck with your game projects!

I did a mockup of some sort of treasure room or something like that and decided to make a simple tileset out of it.

Itâ€™s free, so use it as you wish :)

I hope you like this small tileset.

I'm available for commissioned work. If you want some help making your game look great, feel free to reach me on my e-mail "oucemar@gmail.com".

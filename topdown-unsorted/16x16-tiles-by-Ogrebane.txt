Includes blue and green water, blue and orange bricks (two variants each), lava tiles, trash, pipes, wooden floors/walls, and brown bricks with several variants.

They're not perfect, but I'll probably be adding more variants to then at some point in the future, so I'll save the fine-tuning until then. :)

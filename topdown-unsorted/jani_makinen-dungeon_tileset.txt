This is a tileset I've worked on as a hobby, I'm planning to improve and increase the tile set contents but for now it is limited to these tiles. I hope they might be useful for your projects :)

You may use these tiles for any purpose, all of these are made by me originally.

I'd appreciate my nickname: gfx0 in your games credits if you use these and an email so I can check the project using this for fun.

This is a buildings set I made for one of my games. I decided to change the gameart towards isometric style. Now that these buildings are no longer being used in my game I decided I wanted to upload them here in case anyone ever needs them!

You may or may not give me credits but I would appreciate if you were to credit me!
Also if you finish something and use one of my uploaded assets I would love to hear about it so please email me at -> herzleiid@gmail.com

This sheet is a work-in-progress.  I will finish it eventually.

Not only is this art free to be used in any form but the character himself is also free to be used in your stories.

Character name: Vax
Gender: M
Backstory (WIP): Vax woke up in a stasis tube in a dark, dirty laboratory.  He was in pain but not from the deformed, claw-like hand.  He had s spike jutting from one side of his head and a tender wound on the opposite side of his head.  He tried to feel the wound but it hurt tremendously to touch.  It seemed to be the least of his worries, though.

Vax needed to find out who turned him into this freakish monstrosity.  He found clues but nothing concrete until he found himself able to absorb the thoughts of other test subjects.  Through killing and dissecting other creatures, he found fragments of memories of the people who experimented on him.

For the longest time, Vax was underground, searching through a vast lab environment.  He fought many dangerous creatures and enhanced his powers through absorption of viruses.  Because of this pattern of absorbing and destroying plague-like viruses, he nicknamed himself Vax, short for vaccine.  He thought of himself as the cure to whatever was going on, but he had no idea what was in store for him once he exited the lab.

The story could be altered however you like and used for other characters if you prefer.  The story may be adopted for use in video games, comics, or whatever else you can think of.  Just make sure I get credit where it is due.  :)

Woah... It took me some time, but i... I made my very first tileset! From scratch! Ever! A tileset! From me! Made with my OWN hands! :D

The archive includes a sample map for the Tiled editor with predefined brushes, so you can easily play around with the tileset. You can download Tiled here: http://www.mapeditor.org/

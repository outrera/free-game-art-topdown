These are some CC0 licensed resources from the game C-Dogs SDL:

https://cxong.github.io/cdogs-sdl/

I manually went through the files, took only the ones under CC0 and made a tile (16 x 12) sheet from them. The sheet is compatible with tile editors such as Tiled.

I also put the game font in the package as it is also CC0.

Note that the floor and wall tiles are monochrome and are intended to be colored (take a look at the game screenshots).

I am NOT the author of any of these resources, I merely redistribute them to make them more accessible. The author of most of these sprites is Cong Xu. Please support the original authors.

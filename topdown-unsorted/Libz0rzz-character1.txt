Just some stuff I was working on ages ago, but never finished them. Still need a lot of touch ups and fixing. It's not in a proper tileset, so you will need to pull stuff out if you want to use it efficiently.

I do have layered versions of it, but they're a bit messy and are in .pyxel format. Can send them, if someone wants them and has pyxel edit.

Youtube video with the tileset in use.

 Use 'em however you like :)

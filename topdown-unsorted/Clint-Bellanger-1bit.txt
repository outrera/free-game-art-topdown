Here's a fantasy-RPG set of 64 tiles using 1bit color (black/white only).  For the Minimalist challenge.

Feel free to steal this game idea.

Imagine an adventure/rpg game where the villain has stolen 7 bits from the kingdom and only 1 bit remains safe. The hero has to go retrieve the other 7 bits.

The game starts with 1 bit color graphics (black/white only).
When the first bit is saved, the game enters 2 bit color graphics (cga style).
At 4 bits the game goes 16 color (ega style).
Then all 8 bits are retrieved before the finale (256 color vga style).

This tileset is a FREE release for anybody to download. 

This tileset is a mini-expansion for the Time Fantasy RPG assets. It's compatible with all other graphics that I release  in my Time Fantasy style. Can also be used as a standalone tileset.

I created this set as a reward for reaching a goal on my Patreon page. Thanks to my wonderful patrons for making this free release possible! 

To support my work and contribute towards more free releases in the future, check out the page here: www.patreon.com/finalbossblues 

This set includes versions formatted for use in RPGMaker VX/Ace and RPGMaker MV, as well as a regular tile-sheet based on a 16x16 grid. Also includes animated character-sets for doors and floating debris.

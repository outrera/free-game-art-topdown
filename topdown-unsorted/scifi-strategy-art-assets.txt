Motivation

Art for a Sci-Fi Strategy Game what I wanted to do, but did not had the time and/or money to do.
The art was bought by me on upwork.com and drawn by an artist, whose name/account I currently cannot find.
I'm publishing this here so that someone else may have a better start / use for this art, which can be freely used with the CC0 license.
Inspired by: Supreme Commander, Starcraft, Advance Wars

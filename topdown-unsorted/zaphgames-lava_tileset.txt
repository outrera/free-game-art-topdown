This tileset was made for Orake Online, for a new lava based area where a minotaurs haunts the dungeons. It doesnt consist of walls, it's very simple, though there's tiles for different level of lava, and greek-ish pillars which can be used for decoration. Might add the spritesheet for the minotaur, if it's asked for. :)

If it's used I'd like "zaphgames" in credits or somehow implementing it in your game. Maybe as an easter egg, or something. Other then that, enjoy!

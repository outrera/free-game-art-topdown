It's a pine tree made to fit a game that is using 16x16 graphics. The tree doesn't perfectly align with 16x16 tiles because that wasn't an issue for what I was planning to use it for. Thus you may need to change it slightly to fit your needs. The preview picture is sized up for easier viewing, but the download is the original size.

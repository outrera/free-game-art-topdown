At first i was just trying to create some zelda-like exterior stuff, but then got the urge to create a tileset for an interior house and worked the last few days on it.

There are things in it which i like better than other parts, but that's it for my current skill level and it would make me happy if someone has a use for this. Let me tell you, my eyes were burning! :)
